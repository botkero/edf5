# Earth Defense Force - Wiki (proof-of-concept)

This project is still in the very beginning. It currently more a concept to transfer wiki-like pages to a static site generator. I am using `mkdocs` for the project, with `material` as theme.  I think this has potential for people to more easily learn about the Earth Defense Force game and get help. Furthermore, it can serve as a suggestion for other people not to host their future projects on wiki pages.
