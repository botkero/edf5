# Earth Defense Force - Wiki (proof-of-concept)

This project is still at the very beginning. The goal is to create a wiki for the game Earth Defense Force 5. The focus is especially on part 5 to be able to go into all details. Furthermore, the motivation is to try an alternative wiki concept based on `Static-Site-Generator`, which can be found frequently in documentations for software projects.

For this project, I use the `Static-Site-Generator` called [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The theme used is [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). The choice of these technologies is mainly due to my job background, where these technologies are used. If anyone is interested in creating a wiki in a similar form, feel free to use an alternative.
