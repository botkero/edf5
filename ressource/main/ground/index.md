Alien creatures brought in by the alien civilization known as Primers.  
Due to their highly aggressive nature towards native species, they were given the name "Aggressive Alien Species α" ("AASα" in short).  
Approximately 11 meters in total length. They are surprisingly agile, even though they are giant as the size of elephants.  
They're also capable of crawling up the walls vertically, with no visible decrease in speed.  
Their primary weapon is their big fangs, but the most dangerous weapon is their ability to spray strong acid.  
This acid can reach targets up to 100 meters away and people confirmed the metals melting within seconds.

They are thought to be a subspecies of AASα. Since they are huge in size and wrapped in a hard crust that can even repeal bullets, a strong firepower is required to exterminate them. But due to their inability to spray acid, they are not as hard to defeat.

They are code named "Aggressive Alien Species β" ("AASβ" in short). Even though they were thought to be far less agile than "AASα", the troop which fought with them were heavily damaged. Therefore, they seem to possess high combat capabilities after all.

A third type of aggressors brought in by the aliens (Primers?). They are code named "AASγ".
Since they move very slow, at first they appear to be of no threat. But they are capable of extremely dangerous and effective attacks that utilize their enormous body. They roll themselves up into a sphere and start crushing everything which appear in their path.
Fortunately, since our weapons can penetrate their exoskeleton, to exterminate them is not considered impossible.
