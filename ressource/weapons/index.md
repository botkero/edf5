!!! note 

    At the moment I am undecided about how I want to keep the weapons lists.  I am still thinking that these large tables are useless and that one can just as well use other sources that can also be linked from this wiki. I think that individual weapon descriptions are more elaborate overall, but can offer more added value in detail if expanded. It is also much more convenient for mobile users.

# Weapons

=== "Ranger"

    === "Assault Rifles"

        {% 
            include-markdown "ranger.md" 
            start="<!--intro-start-->"
            end="<!--intro-end-->"
        %}

=== "Wing Diver"


=== "Fencer"


=== "Air-Raider"
