# Destroy the Giant Ship

![Destroy the Giant Ship](../images/missions_thumbnails/M010.jpg)

We're about to commence attack on the Motherships that are hovering over the city. We suspect they keep themselves low in order to drop monsters.

The damage will be incalculable if we don't do something.
There's no time for the Air Force to come and attack. Ground units, head straight to the Motherships. Eliminate all monsters and drones.
After you complete that, fire at the Motherships.
