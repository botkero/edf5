The airstrike on the mysterious monster Erginus has succeeded. Erginus is dying and cannot move. We're ready to launch another round of airstrike to kill it completely. We will still deploy ground forces just in case.

Dozens of EMCs will also join the mission. We've gone this far, the chance of failure should be less than a hundred million to one.
