The flying-type is getting close to the city and they're coming in large number.
Vehicles equipped with anti-air missiles have been dispatched to the site. The anti-air missiles are proved to be effective against the flying-type.
Powered exoskeletons will provide escort, shooting down any flying-types that approach the vehicles.

Please join the troops and offer support.
