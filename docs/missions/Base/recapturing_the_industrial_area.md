A lot of landing ships reached the industrial area which is now occupied by the aliens. Although launching a massive attack would be more optimal, we had to tone it down in order to avoid collateral damage to a nearby refinery.
So we'll send out an infantry unit to launch a night raid instead. They should focus only on eliminating aliens and avoid facility damage. The enemy force is made up of alien infantry and escorting shield bearers. Use night as cover and defeat all enemies.
