The Rangers in combat with the aliens are wiped out because the alien troops are escorted by the new weapon shield bearers.
Shield bearers are multi-legged walking machines. They're unarmed, but will produce a light shield that can block out all attacks, functioning as bunkers to protect the aliens. And this is striking: the aliens can fire through it from inside. That is to say, only the ones outside the shield will get hit. Not even airstrikes can destroy the light barrier.
This mission aims to send the Fencer team into the light barrier and destroy the shield bearers. Back up the Fencers.
