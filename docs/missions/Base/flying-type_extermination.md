The objective of this mission is to destroy the nest of the Flying Aggressors.
Since their queens were wiped out, the defenses of the nest should be much lower. Perfect for us to attack. The powered exoskeletons can eliminate the flying-type first and then the heavy artillery follows to destroy the nest.
