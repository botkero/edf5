Multiple motherships have discharged teleportation anchors. The anchors are dropping all over the world, wreaking havoc in those areas.
In our area, they are being dropped intensively in the mountains. They teleport not only monsters, but shield bearers too. The mountain area is becoming an enemy fortress.
Assemble a strike team and destroy the anchors.
