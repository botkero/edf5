Our units got attacked by the aliens and disintegrated. The survivors seem to scatter around hiding in the buildings.
Fortunately, the aliens are huge in size, so it's unlikely for them to find out everyone inside the buildings.

Nevertheless, they can't hide forever without water and food. Those aliens will detect and kill them once they go outside. We can only pray for their safety and hope the rescue team will arrive in time.
