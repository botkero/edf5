It was the alien artillery unit that damaged the city in the past battles. They are equipped with long-ranged weapons which can discharge artillery shells parabolically and destroy the targets regardless of the distance.

Most of our units were destroyed by their artillery fire and the city was damaged severely. If we don't eliminate them now, we'll be put into a more difficult situation.
It's a risk worth taking. We will dispatch our infantry to assault the enemy artillery unit and eliminate them within a very close range. Get prepared.
