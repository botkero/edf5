Today there's a monster army attacking the city.
We did carry out a big-scale extermination operation, but...we lost the battle.
The whole troop was wiped out. We couldn't hold off the monster attack, probably because we have lost most of our battle force.
I'm sorry, but it looks like it's over.

What!?
There is still a unit fighting against the monsters!
It's Storm 4!
All units capable of fighting head to the site.
