Large amount of monsters are confirmed to appear out of the cave we found. It's likely that the monsters reproduce deep underground. It's too dangerous to leave it that way. Let's commence operation cave invasion now.
When invading the nest, the first risk you may face is encountering alien sentinels again at the location where you ran into a horde of monsters last time.
Operation Stage 1, the vanguard should lead and take out the enemy sentinels. After the place is secured, head deep into the nest and eliminate the monsters, making way for the follow-up forces.
