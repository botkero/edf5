Araneas keep rushing out from the teleportation anchors that was dropped in the mountain. The extermination team is heading to the site, but they are struggling with Araneas' webs. They need support from the follow-up force, but our manpower is limited. Please meet up with the follow-up force, and destroy those teleportation anchors protected by Araneas.
