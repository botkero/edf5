The alien outpost has completely taken control over the surrounding areas. Since the city center is now the enemy's sphere of influence, our actions are significantly restricted. If the situation continues, we'll be forced to hand over this area. We must destroy their outpost as soon as possible.
We have come up with two operation plans to destroy the outpost. Let's carry out Plan A in the first stage. Should Plan A fail, we will immediately switch to Plan B.

Plan A: Select several engineers and form a demolition team. They will work with the infantry unit, using a sandstorm as cover to close in on the enemy outpost and blow it up.

Plan B: Launch an artillery strike with heavy tanks Titans and destroy the outpost with overwhelming fire power.
