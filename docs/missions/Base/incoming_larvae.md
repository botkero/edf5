The winged aliens are drawing near the city. We already dispatched Ranger 51 patrolling nearby to rush to the site.
The winged aliens come in great numbers. Ranger 51 might have certain difficulties to hold the defense line alone. We've formed a reinforcement troop, but it might be too late. Go offer support to Ranger 51.
