Oh, it's you!?
It's really good to see you in one piece.
The city is taken by the aliens. Although we managed to hide in the building and survive...the troops were disintegrated. In other words, we're left alone to the enemy. They will find us sooner or later.
We have to search for survivors and escape together.
Calm down and listen to me.
I've got an idea.
