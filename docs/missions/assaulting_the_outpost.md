# Assaulting the Outpost

![Assaulting the Outpost](../images/missions_thumbnails/M035.jpg)

We won the tough battle and succeeded in defending this area. We not only stopped the enemy from attacking, but greatly weakened their forces. Although we have taken heavy casualties too, this is the best chance to strike back. We will round up all possible forces to destroy the enemy outpost.

The outpost is guarded by numerous cannons. Expect heavy artillery fire. This time the heavy tanks and powered exoskeletons will lead the attack. We can shield ourselves with the heavy tanks and destroy those cannons. Once the number of cannons reduces,  the anti-air artillery gets weaker, allowing air force to approach the outpost. If we can launch a double-pronged attack from both land and air, we should be able to destroy the outpost.
