Please participate the monster mop-up operation in Europe.

We successfully defeated the aliens. Our next objective is to eradicate the monsters.
Forces around the world are trying to eliminate the monsters. Some areas were able to eradicate them, but Europe is still struggling with Aggressive Alien Species β. We were dispatched here since we defeated species β before. I think we can manage to survive without you for now. Good luck.
