The aliens are spreading around the world. It looks like our enemy is ready for a full scale assault.
There are also a great amount of aliens coming at us. We need to stop them from approaching the city. Heavy tanks Titans will be deployed to form a line of defense.
We will be confronting an unprecedented large army, so it will be a fierce fight. However, we have a trump card. The new weapon elf-propelled railguns are on the way. Hold the front line until the railguns arrive.
