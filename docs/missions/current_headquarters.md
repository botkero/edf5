You made it too.
The defense line broke and my squad was utterly routed.
You seem to be in the same situation.

……
I'm happy to see you, but I have to go.
Look! That's the alien main force.
If they launch an attack, the retreating allies will be doomed.

I know this is reckless, but our allies are in great danger.
I will go by myself. I won't drag you with me.
See you in the afterlife.
