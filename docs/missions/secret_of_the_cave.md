# Secret of the Cave

We have confirmed a cave that could be the monster's nest. We knew that monsters would move underground, but it's our first time ever to witness them lurking underground.
We will start investigating and commence an operation of annihilation. It's very risky to sneak into the nest...but this is crucial for us to clarify the monster ecology.
The vanguard will lead. If the situation allows, the follow-up forces will move in afterwards. Please meet up with the follow-up forces and wait for further instructions.
