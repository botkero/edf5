You have approached the base successfully.
What comes next is the real obstacle. The base is under the enemy's control. We have to wipe out enemies on the ground first in order to sneak into the underground hangar.

And that's operation stage 2. The enemy is large in number. This is a dangerous mission, but the air force will provide cover. You can do this. Go!
