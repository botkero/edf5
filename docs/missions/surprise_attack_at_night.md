The aliens have taken over the industrial area. Many important facilities are gathered here. Losing this area would be devastating to humanity and we wish to reclaim it without damaging the facilities. Since airstrikes and heavy tanks will certainly cause damages, they are excluded from the mission.

The only choice is to dispatch a few men to launch a surprise attack at night. Given the high risk, we only summon the elites. Please join force with the unit, approach and eliminate the enemy under the cover of night. And please, try your best to avoid damaging the facilities.
