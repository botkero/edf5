Multiple queens were defending the nest of the flying-type, but suddenly all queens started to move. They led numerous flying-types to the mountain and gathered there.
It's likely part of their reproductive behavior. Perhaps those queens found the original nest too crowded and thus tried to find a location for a new hive. If that is the case, it's threatening. We must eliminate the queens and stop the flying-types from multiplying.
