# Turning Point

Congratulations! You are enrolled.

Five months have passed since the alien invasion.
We fought hard, but as long as the large flying saucers remain out there, our days of hardship will not be over.

Those large flying saucers continue dropping monsters without mercy, and we are having a war of attrition. At this rate, it's only a matter of time till we exhaust all our resources.
Nevertheless, extinguishing monsters is our only choice.
If only we could find a way to destroy the large flying saucers...
