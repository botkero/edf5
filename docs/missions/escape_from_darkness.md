The monsters came from nowhere and we don't know if there are more of them lurking in the dark. And to make it worse, we can't make contact with the ground. We're stranded at the bottom of the base.

But we can't sit around waiting. We must find the rest of our comrades and escape. I will protect you, Civilian, but I don't know what will happen. If we're in bad luck, we're going to fight the monsters. Get prepared for battle.
