Today you're assigned to Base 228. After arrival, please follow the staff's instruction and confirm your duties. 

The base will open up to the public this afternoon. EDF has been putting great efforts in building a better relationship with the neighborhood over the years. A large number of visitors are expected. Security and safety will be your primary concern.
