> The flying-type is getting close to the city and they re coming in large number. Vehicles equipped with anti-air missiles have been dispatched to the site. The anti-air-missiles are proved to be effective against the flying-type.
> Powered exoskeletons will provide escort, shooting down any flying-types that approach the vehicles.
> Please join the troops and offer support.
