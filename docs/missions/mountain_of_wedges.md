# Mountain of Wedges

![Mountain of Wedges](../images/missions_thumbnails/M024.jpg)

Lots of monsters are found in the mountain. There are traces of pylons crashing down, so we suspect those monsters were transmitted by the teleportation devices.
Send over the investigation team at once. Find the pylons and destroy them.
