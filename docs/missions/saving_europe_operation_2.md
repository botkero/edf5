The motherships will fly over our airspace in a few hours. We suspect those motherships will drop teleportation anchors in this area. If the anchors  crash down into the city, they will cause severe casualties.
Our first objective is to quickly destroy the anchors the moment they crash down. In order to do this, we're going to deploy our units over a wide area. The team closest to the drop location should take care of them immediately.
Wait at the designated location and swiftly destroy those dropping anchors.
