> Our defense line was destroyed by battle robots; the city was set ablaze by the monsters..Citizens who failed to escape have given up all hope and itâ€™s nearly impossible to launch a rescue mission. For now, the enemy in this area has been held back, but destruction is nigh. They have pinned us down, and we are unable to assemble the necessary force to take back the city. But we can't just sit and Wait for destruction. We ll launch a raid led by the infantry and reclaim the city.
