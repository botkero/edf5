A great number of teleportation anchors have landed in the urban area. Not only aliens are being transmitted, but shield bearers too. This neighborhood has been in the aliens' hand.
Assemble a strike team at once and eliminate the enemy.

Only the infantry can destroy those anchors protected by the shield bearers. Good luck.
