Humanity, fight against fate.
Now begins the ultimate battle between huge aliens and the EDF.
The world's very existence is at stake with this war.

Year 2022.
A case was taking place in the base 228 of EDF.
Deep underground, the huge facility was invaded, and people were attacked by unknown monsters.
At the same time, a gigantic mothership flew around the world and began attacking without discrimination.
