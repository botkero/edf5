Flight soldiers equipped with flight-units.
Elite troops consisted only for women. They fly across the sky using energy weapons that don't require ammunitions.
Compared to Rangers, their armor or sustainability is next to nothing, but they make up for it with their superb mobility and powerful weapons.
